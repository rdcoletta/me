<p>In this large collaborative project, the genome of 26 maize lines were sequenced and assembled in an effort to build the maize pan-genome. One of the main results of this projects was that combining structural variants (SVs) and SNPs from this pan-genome increased the power of mapping studies like GWAS. In order to do these tests, I had to project SV information from the all maize lines to their ~5,000 recombinant lines using the TASSEL software. Nearly 95% of all SVs were projected with accuracy of 92%. The complete step-by-step can be found in this <a href="https://github.com/HuffordLab/NAM-genomes/blob/master/structural-variation/projecting-svs.md">GitHub page</a>.</p>
