description: "Driven computational biologist focused on delivering improved and resilient crops to maintain food supply and progress towards healthier societies and ecosystems. My fascination with the power of big data analysis in answering relevant biological questions stems from walking the fields with my grandfather in his small farm operation. Growing up in rural Brazil, a country where agriculture has been the main driver of economic development, strengthened my appreciation of farming and plant science. I strive to help farmers supply food to peopleâ€™s tables by finding ways to make food production more sustainable."
